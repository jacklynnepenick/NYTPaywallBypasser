## How to use

To use user scripts you need to first install a user script manager. I recommend [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/), as that's what I've tested it in and it works in most browsers.  Here are some other managers:

- [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) - Firefox
  - Supports GM 4 userscripts.
- [Greasemonkey for Pale Moon](https://github.com/janekptacijarabaci/greasemonkey/releases) - Pale Moon
  - Supports GM 3 userscripts.
- [Firemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/firemonkey/) - Firefox
  - Supports GM 4 userscripts and some GM 3 userscripts.
- [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) - Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Opera, Firefox (also with support for mobile Dolphin Browser and UC Browser)
  - Supports both GM 3 and GM 4 userscripts.
- [USI](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/userunified-script-injector/) - Firefox
  - Supports some GM 3 userscripts.
- [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) - Chrome, Firefox, Maxthon, Opera
  - Supports both GM 3 and GM 4 userscripts.

The most popular userscript managers are Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, and Violentmonkey.

There's no focused plugins to get Userscripts running on Internet Explorer, but the [Adguard](https://adguard.com/) extension provide this feature.

Next, just click [Install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackwpenick/NYTPaywallBypasser/master/nytpaywallbypasser.user.js)
